Artist Showcase</h1>
<h5>
Leonardo da Vinci</h5>
<p>
  Leonardo da Vinci was a Renaissance painter, sculptor, architect, inventor, military engineer and draftsman â€” the epitome of a true Renaissance man. 
  Gifted with a curious mind and a brilliant intellect, da Vinci studied the laws of science and nature, which greatly informed his work. 
  His drawings, paintings and other works have influenced countless artists and engineers over the centuries. 
  Well He's back, for this extremely special event we took it upon ourselves to resurrect him and he will be giving seminars on November 22 to make up for all the time he missed.
  Art fans get ready for November 22nd because he's back and you don't want to miss this.</p>
